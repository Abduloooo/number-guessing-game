# number-guessing-game
A simple Python game where you try to guess a number between 1 and 100.  The computer randomly selects a number, and you can guess until you give up. 



How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Enter a number between 1 and 100.
3. The computer will tell you if your guess is correct.
4. You can play again as many times as you like!

Features
